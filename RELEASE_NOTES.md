## 6.0.0

- Same as 6.0.0-alpha-2

## 6.0.0-alpha-2

- Added `setContentType` handler
- Made the `RecyclableMemoryStreamManager` configurable through DI
- Improved `Xml.Serializer` to also make use of the `RecyclableMemoryStreamManager`

## 6.0.0-alpha-1

Upgraded to .NET 6 and F#'s new native `task` computation expression.

## 5.0.0

Stable release of latest 5.0.0 RC with additional XML comment fixes to comply with latest F# compiler services.

## 5.0.0-rc-6

Updated `Ply` from `0.1.*` to `0.3.*`.

## 5.0.0-rc-5

Replaced `TaskBuilder.fs` with `Ply` for Giraffe's `task` computation expressions. Please see [#421](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/pull/421) for more information.

This was a change long in the making and has been factored into the 5.0.0 release. Ply is being actively developed by Crowded and has better exception stack traces for task computations and several performance improvements over TaskBuilder.fs.

## 5.0.0-rc-4

- Fixed bug when a `NestedEndpoint` preceded a `MultiEndpoint` in `Giraffe.EndpointRouting` (see [#452](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/452))
- Removed the sub-module `GiraffeMiddleware` from the `Giraffe.EndpointRouting` module (simply keep using the `UseGiraffe` extension method of an `IApplicationBuilder`)
- Added an overload for `UseGiraffe` to pass in an `Endpoint list`:
    - Before:
        ```fsharp
        app.UseEndpoints(fun e -> e.MapGiraffeEndpoints(endpoints))
        ```
    - Now:
        ```fsharp
        app.UseGiraffe(endpoints)
        ```

## 5.0.0-rc-3

- Added `ReadBodyBufferedFromRequestAsync` extension method to buffer and read a the request body and make subsequent reads possible (see [#449](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/449))
- Changed how the serialization modules are structured:
    - `IJsonSerializer` is now `Json.ISerializer`
    - `Utf8JsonSerializer` is now `Utf8Json.Serializer`
    - `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer` is now `NewtonsoftJson.Serializer`
    - `SystemTextJsonSerializer` is now `SystemTextJson.Serializer`
    - `IXmlSerializer` is now `Xml.ISerializer`
    - `DefaultXmlSerializer` is now `SystemXml.Serializer`
- Converted all `HttpContext` extension methods into C# compatible extension methods, meaning that function arguments had to be merged into tuples
- Removed the `=>` operator from `Giraffe.EndpointRouting`
- Changed the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, etc. functions to accept an `Endpoint list` instead of an `Endpoint`
    - Before: `GET => route "/foo" (text "bar")`, After: `GET [ route "/foo" (text "bar") ]`
    - One can now compose routes easier:
        ```fsharp
        GET [
            route "/a" (text "A")
            route "/b" (text "B")
            route "/c" (text "C")
        ]
        ```
- Added `GET_HEAD` to the endpoint routing functions, which will handle a `HEAD` request for the same `GET` handler.

## 5.0.0-rc-2

- Fixed pre-conditions validation issue (see [#424](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/424))
- Fixed parsing issue with Guids and ShortIds in `Giraffe.EndpointRouting` (see [#447](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/447))
- Added `routexp` http handler to default router (see [#446](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/446))

## 5.0.0-rc-1

Upgraded to .NET 5. The 5.x version of Giraffe is targeting `net5.0` and dropping support for all other target frameworks. If you cannot upgrade a project to .NET 5 yet then stay on an older version of Giraffe until you can. Giraffe has always been a .NET Core centered project and in the .NET Core world (and now .NET 5 world) there is little to no reason why a project should remain on an old .NET Core version for a long time when upgrade paths are mostly as simple as changing the `<TargetFramework>` property in an `.fsproj` file.

### Summary of changes going into 5.0.0-rc-1

- Only supported target framework is .NET 5

- Added `Giraffe.EndpointRouting` namespace with a version of a few routing handlers which integrate with ASP.NET Core's endpoint routing API
    - Currently supported are: `route`, `routef`, `subRoute` and HTTP verb handlers such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
    - Check the [Endpoint Routing](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/v5.0.0-rc-1/DOCUMENTATION.md#edpoint-routing) documentation for more details
    - Or check the [`EndpointRoutingApp` sample app](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/tree/v5.0.0-rc-1/samples/EndpointRoutingApp) for how to use `Giraffe.EndpointRouting`
- Replaced `Giraffe.GiraffeViewEngine` with the standalone NuGet package `Giraffe.ViewEngine`
- New `JsonOnlyNegotiationConfig` for setting a content negotiation policy which only supports JSON serialisation (no XML for those who don't need it)
- Added `SystemTextJsonSerializer` which uses `System.Text.Json` for JSON serialisation when configured as the desired JSON serializer in Giraffe
- Improved RegEx http handlers in original (non Endpoint routing) http handlers
- Swapped Markdown docs for XML docs for all functions.
- Added support for complex model binding (see [#416](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/416))

## 5.0.0-alpha-003

- Enhanced Endpoint routing with a metadata list (see [PR #437](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/pull/437))

## 5.0.0-alpha-002

- Swapped Markdown docs for XML docs for all functions.
- Improved endpoint routing by deferring the creation of `RequestDelegate` functions.
- Added dependency to new `Giraffe.ViewEngine` package and re-introduced the `htmlView` and `WriteHtmlViewAsync` functions into Giraffe.
- Added support for complex model binding (see [#416](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/416))

## 5.0.0-alpha-001

- Only supported target framework is .NET Core 3.1 (in preparation for .NET 5)
- Added `System.Text.Json` serializer
- Added `Giraffe.EndpointRouting` namespace with a super early alpha version of new routing handlers which integrate with ASP.NET Core's endpoint routing API (check out the `EndpointRoutingApp` sample app for examples before the documentation is ready)
- Removed `Giraffe.GiraffeViewEngine` (in preparation to distribute it as a separate NuGet package, which doesn't exist yet). This release has no `GiraffeViewEngine` which is one of the reasons why it's an `alpha-001` release. Plans are to bring it back in `5.0.0-alpha-002`
- New `JsonOnlyNegotiationConfig` for setting a content negotiation which only supports JSON serialisation and not XML
- Improved RegEx http handlers in original (non Endpoint routing) http handlers
- Added `SystemTextJsonSerializer` which uses `System.Text.Json` for JSON serialisation when configured as the desired JSON serializer in Giraffe

## 4.1.0

- Removed redundant dependencies
- Fixed model binding for arrays (see [#403](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/403))
- Fixed pre-condition bug for the `If-Unmodified-Since` HTTP header (see [#402](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/402))
- Added `netcoreapp3.1` support

## 4.0.1

Fixed dependency references for TFM `netcoreapp3.0` projects.

## 4.0.0

Giraffe 4.0.0 has been tested against `netcoreapp3.0` alongside `netcoreapp2.1` and `net461`. All sample code has been upgraded to .NET Core 3.0 as well.

#### ATTENTION:

This release of Giraffe fixes a bug in the `routef` handler which would have previously matched a route too eagerly.

##### Before:

```
Route: /foo/bar/hello/world
routef: /foo/bar/%s
Match: true
```

##### Now:

```
Route: /foo/bar/hello/world
routef: /foo/bar/%s
Match: false
```

For more information please see [issue #347](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/347).

#### New features

- Support array of 'T as a child in form binding
- Added a new `DateTime` extension method `ToIsoString` which produces a RFC3339 formatted string, and corrected the docs on the existing `ToHtmlString` extension method which actually produces a RFC822 formatted string.

#### Bug fixes and breaking changes

- Fixed `routef` to not match more than one URL path segment.
- Fixed the `_ariaLabelledBy` attribute in the `GiraffeViewEngine`
- Fixed case insensitive route handlers on Ubuntu
- Changed minimum version of `Newtonsoft.Json` to `11.0.2`. This allows Giraffe to be compatible with Azure Functions.
- Renamed `tryMatchInput` to `tryMatchInputExact` and swapped the order of arguments so that the string value comes last
- Added new version of `tryMatchInput` which accepts `MatchSettings` record:

    ```fsharp
    type MatchMode =
        | Exact                // Will try to match entire string from start to end.
        | StartsWith           // Will try to match a substring. Subject string should start with test case.
        | EndsWith             // Will try to match a substring. Subject string should end with test case.
        | Contains             // Will try to match a substring. Subject string should contain test case.

    type MatchOptions = { IgnoreCase: bool; MatchMode: MatchMode; }
    ```

## 3.6.0

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in the `subRouteCi` http handler, which prevented nested sub routes to be case insensitive.

#### New features

- Added two new `HttpContext` extension methods to retrieve cookie and form values:
    - `GetCookieValue (key : string)`
    - `GetFormValue (key : string)`

## 3.5.1

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in Giraffe's model binding to not try to set read only properties anymore.

## 3.5.0

#### New features

- Updated all packages and framework library dependencies to .NET Core 2.2.
- Added a new `GET_HEAD` http handler (see: [#314](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/314) for more info).
- Added a new convenience function called `handleContext`, which can be used for creating new `HttpHandler` functions.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed the `_data` attribute in the `GiraffeViewEngine` to accept a `key` and `value` parameter now.

## 3.4.0

#### New features

- Added a new http handler called `authorizeRequest` to authorize a request based on a `HttpContext -> bool` predicate.
- Added a new http handler called `authorizeUser` which is an alias for `evaluateUserPolicy`. The `evaluateUserPolicy` handler will be removed in the next major release.

## 3.3.0

#### New features

- Added `str` as an alias for the `encodedText` function from the `GiraffeViewEngine`.
- Added the `HttpContext.GetRequestUrl()` extension method to retrieve the entire URL string of the incoming HTTP request.

## 3.2.0

#### Improvements

- Adding the `charset` parameter in the HTTP `Content-Type` response header when returning a text response (text/plain, text/html) or a JSON or XML response (application/json, application/xml). By default Giraffe is using UTF8 encoding for all its responses.

## 3.1.0

#### New features

- Added a new http handler called `validatePreconditions` to help with conditional requests:

    ```fsharp
    let someHandler (eTag : string) (content : string) =
        let eTagHeader = Some (EntityTagHeaderValue.FromString true eTag)
        validatePreconditions eTagHeader None
        >=> setBodyFromString content
    ```

- Made previously internal functionality for sub routing available through the `SubRouting` module:
    - `SubRouting.getSavedPartialPath`: Returns the currently partially resolved path.
    - `SubRouting.getNextPartOfPath`: Returns the yet unresolved part of the path.
    - `SubRouting.routeWithPartialPath`: Invokes a route handler as part of a sub route.

#### Improvements

- Performance improvements for Giraffe's default response writers.
- Performance improvements of the `htmlView` handler.
- Upgraded to the latest `TaskBuilder.fs` NuGet package which also has the SourceLink integration now.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed the `Successful.NO_CONTENT` http handler, which threw an exception when calling from ASP.NET Core 2.1.

## 3.0.0

#### Breaking changes

- Changed the type `XmlNode` by removing the `RawText` and `EncodedText` union case and replaced both by a single `Text` union case. The HTML encoding (or not) is being done now when calling one of the two helper functions `rawText` and `encodedText`.

    - This change - even though theoretically a breaking change - should not affect the vast majority of Giraffe users unless you were constructing your own `XmlNode` elements which were of type `RawText` or `EncodedText` (which is extremely unlikely given that there's not much room for more nodes of these two types).

- Removed the `task {}` override in Giraffe which was forcing the `FSharp.Control.Tasks.V2.ContextInsensitive` version of the Task CE. This change has no effect on the behaviour of `task` computation expressions in Giraffe. In the context of an ASP.NET Core web application there is not difference between `ContextSensitive` and `ContextInsensitive` which is why the override has been removed. The only breaking change which could affect an existing Giraffe web application is that in some places you will need to explicitly `open FSharp.Control.Tasks.V2.ContextInsensitive` where before it might have been sufficient to only `open Giraffe`.

- Changed the members of the `IJsonSerializer` interface to accommodate new (de-)serialize methods for chunked encoding transfer.

    The new interface is the following:

    ```fsharp
    type IJsonSerializer =
        abstract member SerializeToString<'T>      : 'T -> string
        abstract member SerializeToBytes<'T>       : 'T -> byte array
        abstract member SerializeToStreamAsync<'T> : 'T -> Stream -> Task

        abstract member Deserialize<'T>      : string -> 'T
        abstract member Deserialize<'T>      : byte[] -> 'T
        abstract member DeserializeAsync<'T> : Stream -> Task<'T>
    ```

#### Improvements

- Significant performance improvements in the `GiraffeViewEngine` by changing the underlying composition of views from simple string concatenation to using a `StringBuilder` object.

#### New features

- Support for short GUIDs and short IDs (aka YouTube IDs) [in route arguments](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#routef) and [query string parameters](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#short-guids-and-short-ids).
- Enabled [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/) support for Giraffe source code (thanks [Cameron Taggart](https://github.com/ctaggart))! For more information check out [Adding SourceLink to your .NET Core Library](https://carlos.mendible.com/2018/08/25/adding-sourcelink-to-your-net-core-library/).
- Added a new JSON serializer called `Utf8JsonSerializer`. This type uses the [Utf8 JSON serializer library](https://github.com/neuecc/Utf8Json/), which is currently the fastest JSON serializer for .NET. `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer` is still the default JSON serializer in Giraffe (for stability and backwards compatibility), but `Utf8JsonSerializer` can be swapped in via [ASP.NET Core's dependency injection API](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#json). The new `Utf8JsonnSerializer` is significantly faster (especially when sending chunked responses) than `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer`.
- Added a new `HttpContext` extension method for chunked JSON transfers: `WriteJsonChunkedAsync<'T> (dataObj : 'T)`. This new `HttpContext` method can write content directly to the HTTP response stream without buffering into a byte array first (see [Writing JSON](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#writing-json)).
- Added a new `jsonChunked` http handler. This handler is the equivalent http handler version of the `WriteJsonChunkedAsync` extension method.
- Added first class support for [ASP.NET Core's response caching](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#response-caching) feature.

#### Special thanks

Special thanks to [Dmitry Kushnir](https://github.com/dv00d00) for doing the bulk work of all the perf improvements in this release as well as adding Giraffe to the [TechEmpower Webframework Benchmarks](https://techempower.com/benchmarks/)!

## 2.0.1

Changed the `task {}` CE to load from `FSharp.Control.Tasks.V2.ContextInsensitive` instead of `FSharp.Control.Tasks.ContextInsensitive`.

## 2.0.0

#### Breaking changes

- Changed the name of the handler `requiresAuthPolicy` to `evaluateUserPolicy` in order to better describe its functionality and to avoid a name clash between two newly added handlers for validating ASP.NET Core's `AuthorizationPolicy` objects (see new features).
- Changed how he `AddGiraffe()` extension method registers Giraffe dependencies in ASP.NET Core. It now follows the `TryAdd` pattern which will only register a dependency if it hasn't been registered beforehand.
- Changed the `HttpContext.GetService<'T>()` extension method to throw a `MissingDependencyException` if it cannot resolve a desired dependency.

#### New features

- Added two new http handlers to validate an ASP.NET Core `AuthorizationPolicy` (see: [Policy based authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies?view=aspnetcore-2.1)). The `authorizeByPolicyName` and `authorizeByPolicy` http handlers will use ASP.NET Core's authorization service to validate a user against a given policy.
- Updated `TaskBuilder.fs` to version `2.0.*`.
- Updated ASP.NET Core NuGet packages to latest `2.1.*` versions.
- Enabled `return!` for `opt { }` computation expressions.
- Added `blockquote`, `_integrity` and `_scoped` to the `GiraffeViewEngine`.
- Added attributes for mouse, keyboard, touch, drag & drop, focus, input and mouse wheel events to the `GiraffeViewEngine`.
- Added new accessibility attributes to the `GiraffeViewEngine`. These can be used after opening the `Giraffe.GiraffeViewEngine.Accessibility` module.
- Added a new `Successful.NO_CONTENT` http handler which can be used to return a HTTP 204 response.
- Added more structured logging around the Giraffe middleware.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in `routef`, `routeCif` and `subRoutef` which prohibited to parse multiple GUIDs
- Fixed a bug in `routef`, `routeCif` and `subRoutef` which wrongly decoded a route argument twice (and therefore turned `+` signs into spaces).
- Fixed XML documentation for all Giraffe functions which should make function tooltips nicely formatted again.
- Enabled the `HttpContext.BindModelAsync<'T>()` extension method and the `bindModel<'T>` http handler to also bind to a model in the case of a `PATCH` or `DELETE` http request.

## 1.1.0

#### New features

- Added `subRoutef` http handler (see [subRoutef](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#subroutef))
- Added `routex` and `routeCix` http handler (see [routex](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#routex))
- Improved model binding (see [Model Binding](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#model-binding))
    - Fixed issues: [#121](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/121), [#206](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/issues/206)
    - Added a `TryBindFormAsync` and a `TryBindQueryString` `HttpContext` extension methods
    - Added new `HttpHandler` functions to offer a more functional API for model binding:
        - `bindJson<'T>`
        - `bindXml<'T>`
        - `bindForm<'T>`
        - `tryBindForm<'T>`
        - `bindQuery<'T>`
        - `tryBindQuery<'T>`
        - `bindModel<'T>`
- Added new [Model Validation](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#model-validation) API

To see an example of the new features you can check the official [Giraffe 1.1.0 release blog post](https://dusted.codes/giraffe-110-more-routing-handlers-better-model-binding-and-brand-new-model-validation-api).

#### Bug fixes

- `routeBind` works when nested in a `subRoute` handler now
- `routeBind` doesn't crate a model object any more if the route arguments do not match the provided model

## 1.0.0

First RTM release of Giraffe.

This release has many minor breaking changes and a few bigger features. Please read the changelog carefully before updating your existing application.

#### New features

- JSON and XML serialization is now configurable through Dependency Injection (see [Serialization](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#serialization))
- Added new features to validate conditional HTTP headers before processing a web request (see [Conditional Requests](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#conditional-requests))
- Added streaming capabilities (see [Streaming](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#streaming))
- Added `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `CONNECT` http handlers
- Added more `HttpContext` extension methods to create parity between response writing methods and `HttpHandler` functions (see [Response Writing](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#response-writing) and [Content Negotiation](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#content-negotiation))
- Added detailed XML docs to all public facing functions for better Intellisense support
- The `Giraffe.Common` module auto opens now

- Deprecated `Griaffe.Tasks`. Giraffe uses the original [TaskBuilder.fs](https://github.com/rspeele/TaskBuilder.fs) library now.
- Giraffe comes with a default set of required dependencies which need to be registered via `services.AddGiraffe()` during application startup now
- The `Giraffe.TokenRouter` library has been moved to a separate NuGet package under the same name
- Removed redundant serialization methods
    - Removed `serializeJson`, `deserializeJson<'T>`, `deserializeJsonFromStream<'T>`, `defaultJsonSerializerSettings`, `defaultSerializeJson`, `defaultDeserializeJson<'T>`, `serializeXml` and `deserializeXml<'T>`
- Removed the `customJson` http handler
- Renamed the `html` http handler to `htmlString`
- Renamed the `renderHtml` http handler to `htmlView`
- Renamed `setBodyAsString` http handler to `setBodyFromString`
- Renamed `ReturnHtmlFileAsync()` to `WriteHtmlFileAsync()`
    - The function can also accept relative and absolute file paths now
- Renamed `RenderHtmlAsync()` to `WriteHtmlViewAsync()`
- Removed the overloads for `BindJsonAsync<'T>`, `BindModelAsync<'T>` and `WriteJsonAsync` which accepted an object of type `JsonSerializerSettings`
- Renamed the `signOff` http handler to `signOut` to be more consistent with existing ASP.NET Core naming conventions

To get a summary of the new features and changes you can check the official [Giraffe 1.0.0 release blog post](https://dusted.codes/announcing-giraffe-100).

## 0.1.0-beta-700

#### Breaking changes

- Renamed `portRoute` to `routePorts` to be more consistent with other routing functions (`route`, `routef`, `routeStartsWith`, etc.)

#### New features

- `routef` and `routeCif` both support `%O` for matching `System.Guid` values now
- Added HTML attributes helper functions to the `GiraffeViewEngine`.

Example:

```fsharp
let html = p [ _class "someCssClass"; _id "greetingsText" ] [ encodedText "Hello World" ]
```

## 0.1.0-beta-600

#### Breaking changes

- Renamed `Giraffe.XmlViewEngine` to `Giraffe.GiraffeViewEngine` as it represented more than just an XML view engine.

#### New features

- Added automatic validation of the format string inside `routef` and `routeCif` to notify users of the notorious `%d` vs `%i` error during startup.

## 0.1.0-beta-511

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed `ReadBodyFromRequestAsync` where the stream has been disposed before read could complete.

## 0.1.0-beta-510

#### Improvements

- Explicitly set the encoding to UTF-8 when reading the HTTP body during `ReadBodyFromRequestAsync`

#### New features

- Added the `html` http handler which can be used to return a `text/html` response by passing in the html content as a string variable

## 0.1.0-beta-500

#### New features

- Added a new overload for `GetLogger` of the `HttpContext` extension methods, which allows one to pass in a `categoryName` string in order to initialise a new logger: `let logger = ctx.GetLogger "categoryName"`.
- `BindFormAsync`, `BindQueryString` and `BindModelAsync` accept an additional optional parameter for `CultureInfo`.

#### Breaking changes

- Removed `Giraffe.Tasks` from the `Giraffe` NuGet package and added a new dependency on the newly created `Giraffe.Tasks` NuGet package. You can use the `Giraffe.Tasks` NuGet package from non ASP.NET Core projects now as well.

## 0.1.0-beta-400

#### New features

- Added [HTTP status code helper functions](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe#statuscode-httphandlers).
- Added `defaultSerializeJson` and `defaultDeserializeJson` methods.
- Auto opened default Giraffe modules so that the core functionality can be entirely consumed through a single `open Giraffe` statement.
- The functionality from `Giraffe.Razor.Middleware` and `Giraffe.Razor.HttpHandlers` can be both consumed through a single `open Giraffe.Razor` now.

#### Bug fixes

- Changed the `base` tag from the `XmlViewEngine` from a regular `tag` to a `voidTag` to comply with the HTML spec.

#### Breaking changes

- Renamed all async methods by appending `Async` at the end of the method in order to comply with the general .NET naming convention
    - `readFileAsString` --> `readFileAsStringAsync`
    - `ctx.ReadBodyFromRequest` --> `ctx.ReadBodyFromRequestAsync`
    - `ctx.BindJson` --> `ctx.BindJsonAsync`
    - `ctx.BindXml` --> `ctx.BindXmlAsync`
    - `ctx.BindForm` --> `ctx.BindFormAsync`
    - `ctx.BindModel` --> `ctx.BindModelAsync`
    - `ctx.WriteJson` --> `ctx.WriteJsonAsync`
    - `ctx.WriteXml` --> `ctx.WriteXmlAsync`
    - `ctx.WriteText` --> `ctx.WriteTextAsync`
    - `ctx.RenderHtml` --> `ctx.RenderHtmlAsync`
    - `ctx.ReturnHtmlFile` --> `ctx.ReturnHtmlFileAsync`
- Renamed `Giraffe.DotLiquid.HttpHandlers` module to `Giraffe.DotLiquid`

## 0.1.0-beta-310

#### New features
- Added `portRoute` http handler to filter an incoming request based on the port

#### Breaking changes
- The `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` http handlers of the `TokenRouter.fs` have changed to accept a list of http handlers now.

#### Bug fixes
- TokenRouter fringe case not being identified before (see #150)

## 0.1.0-beta-300

#### New features

- Added `requiresAuthPolicy` http handler
- Added `RenderHtml` and `ReturnHtmlFile` extension methods to the `HttpContext` object
- Added `customJson` http handler, which allows users to define a custom json handler (with custom serialization settings)
- Added overloads to `BindJson` and `BindModel` where a user can pass in a custom `JsonSerializerSettings` object

#### Breaking changes

- Changed the default json serializer to use camel case for serialization (this change prevents users from being able to change the default serializer through the `JsonConvert.DefaultSettings` object - use `customJson` instead if customization is required)
- Changed the `serializeJson`, `deserializeJson` methods to accept an aditional parameter of type `JsonSerializerSettings`

#### Bug fixes and improvements

- Automatically URL decoding of string values when using `routef`
- Fixed an inference bug with `routef` by replacing the `format` parameter of the `tryMatchInput` method and the `path` parameter of the `routef` and `routeCif` methods from `StringFormat` to `PrintFormat`
- Changed the implementation of `ctx.BindJson<'T>()` for better performance and which aims to fix an Azure bug with Kestrel (#136)
- Fixed a bug with `routeBind` (#129)
- Improved the `htmlFile` http handler by allowing the `filePath` parameter to be either rooted or relative to the `ContentRootPath`



## 0.1.0-beta-200

- Added three additional `HttpContext` extension methods in the `Giraffe.HttpContextExtensions` module: `WriteJson`, `WriteXml` and `WriteText`. These three methods can be used for direct HttpReponse writing from within a custom handler without having to sub-call the `json`, `xml` or `text` http handlers.
- Changed the `UseGiraffeErrorHandler` method to return an `IApplicationBuilder` now. This change allows [middleware chaining](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe/pull/118). This is a breaking change and you'll either have to chain middleware or append an `|> ignore` in your application set up.

## 0.1.0-beta-110

Added the `Giraffe.TokenRouter` module for [speed improved route handling](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe/issues/56).

## 0.1.0-beta-102

Improved the `routeBind` http handler to give users more flexibility in mapping routes to HTTP requests (see #110).

## 0.1.0-beta-101

- Fixed bug in connection with the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` (see #106)
- Added CORS settings for localhost to the default giraffe-template

## 0.1.0-beta-100

#### Updated Giraffe to .NET Standard 2.0

Attention, this release updated all Giraffe NuGet packages to `net461` and `netstandard2.0`!

You will have to upgrade your ASP.NET Core application to either full .NET framework 461 or to a .NET Core app 2.0.

There were a few minor breaking changes in ASP.NET Core 2.0 which also affected Giraffe. I do not intend to keep maintaining a 1.x version any longer unless there's a very compelling reason. General advice is to upgrade all .NET Core web applications to 2.0.

## 0.1.0-beta-003

#### Giraffe `0.1.0-beta-003`
- Fixed bug where `readFileAsString` closed the stream before the file could be read

#### Giraffe.Razor `0.1.0-beta-002`
- Fixed bug so that `_ViewStart.cshtml` files get respected now

#### giraffe-template `0.1.9`
- Fixed wrong version numbers in package references for `Giraffe` and `Giraffe.Razor`

## 0.1.0-beta-002

- Fixed the `warbler` function. Should work as expected again.
- Added support for `Async<'T>` in the `task {}` workflow. You can use an `Async<'T>` from within `task {}` without having to convert back to a `Task<'T>`
- Set the Giraffe dependency version in the template to a concrete version to avoid breaking changes in the template.

## 0.1.0-beta-001

First Beta release of Giraffe!

#### Major changes:
- [Continuations over binding](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe/pull/71)
- [Tasks instead of Async](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe/pull/75)

The `HttpHandler` has slightly [changed](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe#httphandler).

Blog post with more info is coming shortly!

## 0.1.0-alpha025

Changed the type `XmlAttribute` from the `XmlViewEngine` to accept either a `string * string` key value pair or a boolean attribute of type `string`. This was a missing to enable script tags such as `<script src="..." async></script>`.

Added two helper functions (`attr` and `flag`) to simplify the creation of those attributes:

```fsharp
script [
    attr "src" "http://example.org/example.js"
    attr "lang" "javascript"
    flag "async" ] []
```

## 0.1.0-alpha024

- New `routeBind` http handler
- Annotated all default http handler functions with the `HttpHandler` type

## 0.1.0-alpha023

#### Bug fixes:

- Fixed build error in the Giraffe template.

#### Further improvements to the `XmlViewEngine`:

- Renamed `renderXmlString` to `renderXmlNode` and renamed `renderHtmlString` to `renderHtmlNode`
- Added two more methods which accept a `XmlNode list`: `renderXmlNodes` and `renderHtmlNodes`
- Changed the return value of `encodedText` and `rawText` to return a single `XmlNode` instead of `XmlNode list`. This has the advantage that it can be used from within another list, which was not possible before.

Before:

```
let view =
    html [] [
        head [] [
            title []  (rawText "Giraffe")
        ]
        body [] (encodedText "Hello World")
    ]
```

Now:

```
let view =
    html [] [
        head [] [
            title []  [ rawText "Giraffe" ]
        ]
        body [] [ encodedText "Hello World" ]
    ]
```

This has the advantage that you can also do this, which wasn't possible before:

```
let view =
    html [] [
        head [] [
            title []  [ rawText "Giraffe" ]
        ]
        body [] [
            encodedText "Hello World"
            p [] [ rawText "Hello" ]
        ]
    ]
```

## 0.1.0-alpha022

A few modifications to the former `HtmlEngine` so that it can be used for correct XML rendering as well:

- Renamed the `Giraffe.HtmlEngine` module to `Giraffe.XmlViewEngine`
- Renamed `HtmlAttribute` to `XmlAttribute`, `HtmlElement` to `XmlElement` and `HtmlNode` to `XmlNode`
- Renamed and make the function `nodeToHtmlString` private
- Added `comment` function to the `Giraffe.XmlViewEngine` module for creating XML comments
- Added `renderXmlString` and `renderHtmlString` functions to `Giraffe.XmlViewEngine` module for rendering XML and HTML nodes.

## 0.1.0-alpha021

- Changed `HttpContext.BindQueryString<'T>()` to return `'T` instead of `Async<'T>`
- Added `HttpContext.TryGetQueryStringValue (key : string)` which returns an `Option<string>`
- Added `HttpContext.GetQueryStringValue (key : string)` which returns a `Result<string, string>`

## 0.1.0-alpha020

Split out the Razor view engine and the DotLiquid templating engine into separate NuGet packages:
- `Giraffe.Razor`
- `Giraffe.DotLiquid`

Please reference the additional packages if you were using any of the view or templating handlers.

Also updated the `giraffe-template` NuGet package with the new changes and adapted the `build.ps1` PowerShell script to successfully build on Linux environments too.

Additionally TravisCI builds are run as part of every commit as well now.

## 0.1.0-alpha019

Adds [support for the `Option<'T>` type when model binding from a query string](https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe/issues/51).

## 0.1.0-alpha018

- Added two new `HttpContext` extension methods:
    - `TryGetRequestHeader (key : string)` which returns an `Option<string>`
    - `GetRequestHeader (key : string)` which returns a `Result<string, string>`
- Added default computation expressions for the `Option<'T>` and `Result<'T, 'TError>` types under `Giraffe.ComputationExpressions`

## 0.1.0-alpha017

#### New features
- Added `plain/text` as a new supported mime type to the default `negotiate` handler (it will be using an object's `.ToString()` method to serialize an object into plain text)
- Added new helper functions for retrieving a logger or dependencies as extension methods of the `HttpContext` object: `ctx.GetService<'T>()` and `ctx.GetLogger<'T>()`

#### Breaking changes
- Completely removed the `HttpHandlerContext` type and replaced all usage with the original `HttpContext` object from ASP.NET Core.
- Extended the `ErrorHandler` function with a parameter to retrieve a default `ILogger` object
- Moved model binding functions from the `Giraffe.ModelBinding` module into the `Giraffe.HttpContextExtensions` module and made them extension methods of the `HttpContext` object

Also updated the `giraffe-template` NuGet package with the latest changes.

## 0.1.0-alpha016

Fixes #46

## 0.1.0-alpha015

Changed the signature of the `redirectTo` http handler (swapped `permanent` with `location`).

## 0.1.0-alpha014

Added `redirectTo` http handler.

## 0.1.0-alpha013

Using culture invariant converters in model binders.

## 0.1.0-alpha012

- Added `bindQueryString` which can automatically bind a model from query string parameters
- Extended `bindModel` to include `bindQueryString` when the HTTP method is not `POST` or `PUT`

## 0.1.0-alpha011

#### New features
- Added a `warbler` function
- Added model binding capabilities which can automatically bind a HTTP payload to a strongly typed model: `bindJson`, `bindXml`, `bindForm` and `bindModel`
#### Improvements
- Improved the `negotiateWith` and `negotiate` http handlers by making use of ASP.NET Core's `MediaTypeHeaderValue` class
- Added `*.cshtml` files to the DotNet watcher in the template
#### Bug fixes
- Fixed `AssemblyName` and `PackageId` values in the template

## 0.1.0-alpha010

Added two new `HttpHandler` functions:
- `negotiate` checks the `Accept` header of a request and determines automatically if a response should be sent in JSON or XML
- `negotiateWith` is the same as `negotiate`, but additionally accepts an `IDictionary<string, obj -> HttpHandler>` which allows users to extend the default negotiation rules (e.g. change default serialization if a client is indifferent, or add more supported mime types, etc.)

## 0.1.0-alpha009

- Added a new programmatic view engine called `Giraffe.HtmlEngine`
- Addd a new `HttpHandler` named `renderHtml` to return views from the new view engine

## 0.1.0-alpha008

- Created a NuGet package called `giraffe-template` which is a new `dotnet new` template for Giraffe projects
- Removed `RazorLight` as a dependency and replaced it with the official razor engine by ASP.NET Core MVC
- Renamed the HttpHandler `htmlTemplate` to `dotLiquidHtmlView`
- Added a new HttpHandler named `dotLiquidTemplate`. The difference is that it let's the caller decide what `Content-Type` the response shall be.
- Renamed the HttpHandler `razorView` to `razorHtmlView`
- Added a new HttpHandler named `razorView`. The difference is that it let's the caller decide what `Content-Type` the response shall be.

## 0.1.0-alpha006
